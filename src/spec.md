# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the site’s visual theme to a modern “smart blue” background direction by adjusting Tailwind theme tokens so global and section backgrounds shift away from the current warm-neutral palette.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Tailwind theme tokens/CSS variables to apply cohesive smart-blue tints for light mode background, muted, and accent surfaces.
- Adjust primary interactive color tokens (e.g., primary button color, focus ring, primary icon color) to align with the smart-blue palette while preserving readability/contrast.
- Verify Home, Services, About, and Contact consistently reflect the updated theme without layout or readability regressions.

**User-visible outcome:** Across key pages, backgrounds and highlighted sections appear in a cohesive modern corporate blue theme, and primary interactive elements match the updated palette with readable contrast.
